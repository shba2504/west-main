### West & Main

A modern home and decor website using primarily HTML and CSS.

## Description

The goal of this project was to simulate commercial websites like Joss & Main and Pottery Barn. These websites have some interesting designs, some of which I emulated, and others I edited to fit the more modern style of West & Main.

I played with CSS animation, horizontal scrolling, modal/dialog, and intrinsic design to make the website responsive and reduce media queries.

I also read the WCAG docs and tried, as much as possible, to incorporate accessibility standards. There were a few areas where I opted to use background images for an element instead of using an <img> element. However, I could have used the <img> tag and manipulated the heading and paragraph text to sit above the image using the z-index.

## Summary

Websites like West & Main are not only easy to create, but also great to practice and maintain my skills, especially as I learn new ones.
