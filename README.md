### West & Main

A modern home and decor website using primarily HTML and CSS.

## Description

The goal of this project was to simulate commercial websites like Joss & Main and Pottery Barn. These websites have some interesting designs, some of which I emulated, and others I edited.

I built the site using a mobile-first approach, including the navigation bar. I played around with CSS animation for the buttons, hamburger menu, and image transitions. I also added horizontal scrolling, a dialog, and utilized intrinsic design (as much as possible) to make the website responsive and reduce the number of media queries.

For accessibility, I read the WCAG docs and tried, whenever possible, to incorporate accessibility standards. There were a few areas where I opted to use background images for an element instead of using an <img> element. However, I could have used the <img> tag and manipulated the heading and paragraph text to sit above the image using z-index and positioning.

## Summary

Websites like West & Main are not only relatively easy to create, but also great to practice and maintain my skills, especially as I learn new ones.
